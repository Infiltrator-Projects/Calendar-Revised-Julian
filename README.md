# Revised Julian Calendar

**InfiltratorOS calendar resource** · **Stable ID:** `revised-julian` · **Module:** `Revised Julian Calendar.so`

Milanković 1923 leap rule continued arithmetically, anchored where it coincides with Gregorian on 1 January 2000.

**Historical scope/accuracy:** Modern ecclesiastical adoption differs by locality; retrospective dates are mathematical continuation.

**Intended installation:** `/System/Resources/Calendars/Revised Julian Calendar.so` (case-sensitive)

The provider owns fields, localized formatting, period starts and navigation. Field extraction determines the supported date domain; every other operation must reject the same invalid input. Switching calendar presentation cannot rewrite canonical instants or event ordering.

## Status

**Independent source, native installation and releases.** This repository contains the implementation of `revised-julian`, the supporting code it needs, a one-provider `Makefile` and focused regression fixtures. The copy is based on Common 1.19.78 at `8d60662114e3`; the original Common source remains unchanged.

Run `make` to produce `build/Revised Julian Calendar.so` and `make check` to run this provider's checks. No Common checkout or Common archive is required. Independent releases now provide a portable amd64 Debian package, a hardware-native source installer and the complete source ZIP. The original Common source is retained.

See [source provenance and build details](SOURCE.md), [source manifest](SOURCE-MANIFEST.json) and [recorded validation](VALIDATION-RESULTS.json).

## Independent forensic audit

See [audit findings](docs/FORENSIC-AUDIT.md) for corrections, numerical-model limits and unresolved authority disagreements. A successful build is not a historical-accuracy certificate.

## Release and installation

Run `make release` to qualify and create exactly three assets in `dist/`: a portable amd64 `.deb`, a `-native-installer.run`, and a complete `-source.zip`. Linux releases are built and installed by GitHub Actions before publication.

Run the downloaded `.run --profile aggressive` as an ordinary user. It provisions missing build prerequisites, compiles for the local CPU with `-O3`, LTO and measured two-pass PGO, checks the final module, then installs a native Debian package through sudo. InfiltratorOS invokes `--profile aggressive --system-package-mode` from its serialized installation worker. `--build-only --output DIRECTORY` qualifies a native package without installing it.

Each package owns only this provider and its passive documentation. Its `Replaces` declaration transfers this module from `infiltrator-calendar-resources` on existing machines; other modules and Common source remain intact. Native package versions use `+native1` so a same-version generic package does not replace a local optimized build. See [packaging details](docs/PACKAGING.md).

Translations use the provider-owned gettext domain `infiltrator-calendar-revised-julian`. The package ships only its own messages in `/usr/share/locale/<language>/LC_MESSAGES/infiltrator-calendar-revised-julian.mo`; Common’s combined translation package is not required. The exact compiled catalogues are checked through the provider ABI before packaging.

## Illustrated user guide

The installed provider consists of exactly `Revised Julian Calendar.so` and `Revised Julian Calendar.pdf`. Provider translations are embedded in the .so; auditing and PGO/LTO records are kept in source control and Debian control metadata.
