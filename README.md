# Revised Julian Calendar

**InfiltratorOS calendar resource** · **Stable ID:** `revised-julian` · **Module:** `Revised Julian Calendar.so`

Milanković 1923 leap rule continued arithmetically, anchored where it coincides with Gregorian on 1 January 2000.

**Historical scope/accuracy:** Modern ecclesiastical adoption differs by locality; retrospective dates are mathematical continuation.

**Intended installation:** `/System/Resources/Calendars/Revised Julian Calendar.so` (case-sensitive)

The provider owns fields, localized formatting, period starts and navigation. Field extraction determines the supported date domain; every other operation must reject the same invalid input. Switching calendar presentation cannot rewrite canonical instants or event ordering.

## Status

**Documentation-only:** The runnable provider, tests, current combined resource packaging and release process are still in Libraries/Common. This new repository has not yet been populated with executable source, standalone tests, an installer, or a verified release.

This repository is intended to become an independently buildable, testable and installable provider, not a duplicate application-specific implementation. Calendar, Files, System Settings and compatible consumers discover executable providers through Common.
