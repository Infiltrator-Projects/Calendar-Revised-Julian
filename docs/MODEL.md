# Revised Julian Calendar — computational and historical model

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Stable provider ID | `revised-julian` |
| Resource kind | `calendar` |
| Canonical compiled name | `Revised Julian Calendar.so` |
| Intended installation | `/System/Resources/Calendars/Revised Julian Calendar.so` |

## Maintained model

Milanković 1923 leap rule continued arithmetically, anchored where it coincides with Gregorian on 1 January 2000.

## Historical scope / fidelity limitation

**Implemented interpretation:** Milanković revised Julian arithmetic.

**Fidelity boundary:** Modern ecclesiastical adoption differs by locality; retrospective dates are mathematical continuation.

This is an account of the implemented model, not a claim that a particular mathematical projection was observed or officially used in every historical period. Where the source model uses approximations, retrospective continuation or external ICU/CLDR authorities, that distinction must remain explicit.

## Observable behaviour

The provider owns fields, localized formatting, period starts and navigation. Field extraction determines the supported date domain; every other operation must reject the same invalid input. Switching calendar presentation cannot rewrite canonical instants or event ordering.

## Unsupported inputs and reproducibility

Missing providers are unavailable; consumers must not substitute a different provider with a similar name. Malformed or out-of-range inputs must return an explicit failure without modifying outputs. Module metadata must convey its true ID and kind, independent of filename ordering.

## Provenance

The model and boundary above are documented from the current resource build map, Calendar model matrix and Common historical-fidelity audit. They have not yet been independently requalified in this repository.
