# Revised Julian Calendar — validation requirements

**Evidence status:** No independent executable, standalone CI, installer or released artifact is established by these documents. All checkboxes are future gates, not claims of passing tests.

## Qualification checklist

- [ ] Establish exact original Common revision, licensed source provenance, direct and shared dependencies.
- [ ] Keep the implementation limited to stable ID `revised-julian`; do not embed another independent resource's algorithm.
- [ ] Produce the directly named portable shared object `Revised Julian Calendar.so`.
- [ ] Verify metadata version, name, ID, kind, loadability and executable ABI through Common.
- [ ] Verify model-specific computation and historical-reference dates/times against evidence independent of self-round-tripping.
- [ ] Reject malformed, out-of-range and unsupported inputs with bounded work and no caller-owned output mutation.
- [ ] Verify bad/missing/different-kind resources cannot silently fall back or break other installed resources.
- [ ] Test the actual installed package bytes through the native resource directory.
- [ ] Verify clean installation, upgrade, removal and recovery without conflicting with the combined Common package.
- [ ] Record reproducibility, package/hash, build environment and release commit.
- [ ] Confirm consumer discovery in Calendar, Files and System Settings without embedding duplicate implementations.

## Model-specific reference qualification

Cross-check the defined Revised Julian Calendar model and its day/year/representation boundaries against separately established test vectors.

**Documented model:** Milanković 1923 leap rule continued arithmetically, anchored where it coincides with Gregorian on 1 January 2000.

**Fidelity boundary:** Modern ecclesiastical adoption differs by locality; retrospective dates are mathematical continuation.

Also test period start/end, forward/backward navigation, localized output, extreme Julian-day values and consistency of supported-domain rejection across all operations.

## Prior evidence versus independent release evidence

The existing Common suite (`resources/temporal/tests/test-calendars.c`) supplies the starting contract, but a passing Common pack does not prove a standalone package or this repository's release. Attach specific commits, test runs, environments and artifacts before marking any item complete.
